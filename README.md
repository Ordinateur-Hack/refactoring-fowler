# My favorite quotes ðŸ“˜
## Refactoring
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
<br>*â€” Chapter 1, p.22*

> Code that communicates its purpose is very important. I often refactor just when I'm reading some code. That way as I gain understanding about the program, I embed that understanding into the code for later so I don't forget what I learned.
<br>*â€” Chapter 1, p.22*

## Testing
> Notice how I'm playing the part of an enemy to code. I'm actively thinking about how I can break it. I find that state of mind to be both productive and fun. It indulges the mean-spirited part of my psyche.
<br>*â€” Chapter 4, p. 83*

> Don't let the fear that testing can't catch all bugs stop you from writing the tests that  will catch most bugs.
<br>*â€” Chapter 4, Tip, p. 84*

> Build a good bug detector and run it frequently. It is a wonderful tool for any development and is a precondition for refactoring.
<br>*â€” Chapter 4, p. 84*
